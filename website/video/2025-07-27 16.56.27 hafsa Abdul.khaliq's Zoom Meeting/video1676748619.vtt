For our visit…

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:19.136
Our aim? To combine learning. First of all.

00:01:20.403 --> 00:01:25.403

00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:28.678
This is a contract pop-up. So, we built it… from HTML?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:38.240
Css, and Java. We use all these. Mature the website is responsive or not.

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:48.511
So, you can see… This is, uh, that… Responsive website.

00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:56.222

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:11.164

00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:26.994
